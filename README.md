# React-Tac-Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game made in React.js which features both single player and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer mode is designed using Socket.io while the Single Player mode uses Min Max Algorithm (yes, it's an overkill algorithm for a tic-tac-toe game and is impossible to beat)

## How To Run
Run `npm start` on the root, and `node index.js` in the "server" folder.
